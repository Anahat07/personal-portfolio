# Personal Website 🌐

Welcome to my personal website! This is a space I built to reflect **who I am**, **what I’m working on**, and **what I’m learning**—all in one place.

The site showcases my projects, experiences, and a bit of creativity along the way. Building it was a fun hands-on learning experience, from experimenting with design to debugging countless issues 😅. It’s designed to be something I can continue to improve and grow over time.
